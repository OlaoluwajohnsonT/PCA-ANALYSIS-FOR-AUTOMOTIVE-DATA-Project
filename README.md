# PCA-ANALYSIS-FOR-AUTOMOTIVE-DATA-Project

Performed Principal Component Analysis on Automobile Data for An Effective Predictive Modelling

The dataset is a comprehensive compilation of automotive attributes, encompassing 201 entries and 29 columns. It offers a rich array of information, ranging from numerical details like wheel-base, engine size, and price to categorical data such as make, aspiration, and body style. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for exploring the intricate characteristics of automobiles. Among the notable aspects of this dataset are the presence of missing values in the 'stroke' and 'horsepower-binned' columns. These missing values warrant careful consideration during data preprocessing to ensure the integrity of any future analyses. Additionally, this dataset covers a diverse range of car makes and models, making it a suitable candidate for various analytical tasks and predictive modeling.

# MY OBJECTIVES

I conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the dataset to uncover latent patterns and reduce its dimensionality. PCA is a powerful technique that transforms correlated features into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. This allows for a more concise representation of the data while preserving as much of the original information as possible. In this analysis, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset's structure and identify key features contributing to its variance.

Upon completing the PCA, I found that the first few principal components explained a significant portion of the dataset's variance, while subsequent components accounted for progressively less variance. This observation indicates that a reduced set of principal components can capture the essential information present in the original dataset. Additionally, I examined the loadings of each feature on these components to identify which attributes played a more influential role in defining the dataset's variability.

In conclusion, the PCA analysis revealed valuable insights into the dataset's structure and dimensionality reduction potential. By retaining the most informative principal components, I can streamline future analyses, improve model efficiency, and gain a more concise representation of the data, ultimately enhancing the interpretability of the results and facilitating more efficient modeling and decision-making processes.
